# LulzMod CK2 for Ancient Religions Reborn

The AR-compatible version of LulzMod for Crusader Kings II, it depends on **Ancient Religions Reborn**, which can be found on both [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=english&id=396779137) and [the Paradox Forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ancient-religions-reborn.829413/). Deprecated in favour of its [Crusader Kings III-based successor](https://git.sonck.fm/metalhead/paradox-mods/lulzmod-ck3), it won't be updated anymore.
